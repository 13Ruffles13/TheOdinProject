Lesson overview

This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.

    You’ll learn how to use custom fonts on your web projects.
    You’ll learn some more text-related CSS properties.

The system font stack

If you use the font-family property to change to a font like Impact or Times New Roman, and those fonts do not happen to be installed on your user’s computer, then a fallback font will be displayed. If you have not defined a fallback, then the default HTML font will be used, which is often somewhat ugly. For this reason, it’s common to see somewhat long stacks of fonts listed on projects.

One popular stack is CSS Tricks’ system font stack.

Online font libraries

One popular and easy method to get fonts that are not installed on a user’s device is to use an online font library.

To use a font from one of these libraries, go to the website, select a font and then copy a snippet from the website to import that font from their server into your website. You’ll be given either a <link> tag to put in your HTML like so….

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

… or an @import tag that can be dropped at the top of a CSS file.

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap');

An important consideration when using a font library is the library’s privacy policies and any regulations you may need to comply with. For example, using the Google Fonts API violates the European GDPR. If you are concerned about complying with such regulations, you can download the font from the library and host it yourself.
